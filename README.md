# Beat the dealer at 21

Can you beat the dealer at 21 (also known as Blackjack)?

## How to run

Install [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) on your system.

Run Main.kt via Intellij or run ``./gradlew run --args="cards.txt" --console=plain`` in the terminal from the project root,
where ``cards.txt`` is a file containing all the cards in the deck. You can also run the program without any args (``./gradlew run --console=plain``), in which case a new deck will be created and shuffled in the program.

## Test

Run unit tests in Intellij or with ``./gradlew test``.
